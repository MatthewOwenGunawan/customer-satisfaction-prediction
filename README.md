# customer-satisfaction-prediction
This project focuses on predicting customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores based on customer support interaction data. The study applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer feedback and service-related features.

Two ensemble learning models were implemented and compared:
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

To address class imbalance in CSAT scores, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle:  
E-commerce Customer Service Satisfaction Dataset
